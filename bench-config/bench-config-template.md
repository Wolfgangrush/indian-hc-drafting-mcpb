## How to use this file

1. **Copy this template to your case folder:**
   ```bash
   cp <plugin-folder>/bench-config/bench-config-template.md <your-case-folder>/bench-config.md
   ```

2. **Open `bench-config.md` in your editor** and replace every example value with your bench's actual values.

3. **Verify each value against your bench's Practice Notes / Registry directions / Civil Manual.** If unsure, leave the placeholder unfilled and ask the Registry at filing. (The plugin is bench-neutral — Bombay HC is the author's most-validated exemplar, NOT the universal default.)

4. **Save the file inside your case folder.** The plugin's Format agent reads `<case-folder>/bench-config.md` at run-time.

5. **For repeat-use:** save your filled-in bench-config to a personal templates folder so you can reuse it across cases. The plugin does not store your bench-config; it expects to find one in each case folder.

## Contributing bench-config templates

If you practise regularly before a non-Bombay High Court bench, please contribute your filled-in bench-config back to the plugin via a GitHub Issue. Over time, this folder will contain validated templates for every Indian HC bench, lowering the setup burden for advocates joining the plugin's community.

When contributing, do NOT include any case-specific information — only the bench's standard procedural conventions.
