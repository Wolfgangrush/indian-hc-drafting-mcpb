description: Universal Indian High Court pleading skeleton, bench-config-driven. Shared base for all 13 case-type drafting skills. Holds the standard structure (Cause Title → Parties → Statutory Opening → Prelude → FACTS → GROUNDS → PRAYER → Counsel block → Index → Synopsis → List of Annexures → Accompanying Applications). The skeleton itself is structural and uncopyrightable; bench-specific values (Court header, parties separator, section-header style, annexure prefix, counsel block layout, paper/font/margins) are sourced from the user's case-folder `bench-config.md` at run-time. NOT invoked directly — case-type skills extend this.

# Indian HC Pleading — Universal Skeleton (bench-config-driven)

This is the SHARED structure that every Indian High Court pleading follows. The 13 case-type skills extend this with their own statutory openings, grounds structure, prayer language, and accompanying applications.

**Bench-config-driven design:** the structural shape below is universal across Indian HCs. Specific Registry-facing values (Court header text, parties separator, section-header style, annexure prefix, counsel block) vary from bench to bench and are sourced from `<case-folder>/bench-config.md` at run-time. The Format agent substitutes the placeholders below from the user's bench-config; the Drafter renders the final pleading in the user's bench's idiom.

→ See `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/_drafting_common/SKILL.md` for the bench-config-driven rules and the bench-coverage research.
→ See `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bench-config/exemplars/` for bench-config exemplars per HC (Bombay-Nagpur, Bombay-Principal, Delhi, Karnataka, Madras, Calcutta, Allahabad, Punjab & Haryana, Gujarat, Kerala, Rajasthan, etc.).

## BENCH-CONFIG PLACEHOLDERS USED IN THIS SKELETON

Every `{{bench_config.X}}` placeholder below resolves to a value in the user's `<case-folder>/bench-config.md`. The Format agent substitutes at run-time; the Drafter ships the final pleading.

| Placeholder | Resolves to |
|---|---|
| `{{bench_config.court_header}}` | The exact Court header line accepted by the bench's Registry |
| `{{bench_config.parties_separator}}` | `///VERSUS///` (Bombay), `...VERSUS...` (some HCs / applications), `vs.` (some practices) |
| `{{bench_config.section_headers_style}}` | `spaced` (Bombay) or `title-case` (most other HCs) |
| `{{bench_config.salutation_opener}}` | Bench's preferred opener phrase |
| `{{bench_config.annexure_prefix}}` | `ANNEXURE-` (Bombay), `Annexure P/` (Punjab & Haryana, Orissa), `Annexure P-` (Rajasthan), `Exhibit` (Kerala default), `Document No.` (Madras OS), etc. |
| `{{bench_config.annexure_letter_omissions}}` | `[]` (most HCs) or `["I"]` (Karnataka — letter I omitted) |
| `{{bench_config.respondent_annexure_prefix}}` | `R/` (Punjab & Haryana) or none (most HCs) |
| `{{bench_config.counsel_place}}` | `NAGPUR` (Nagpur Bench), `MUMBAI` (Principal Bench), `NEW DELHI` (Delhi), etc. |
| `{{bench_config.advocate_block_template}}` | Bench's preferred Counsel/Advocate signature-block layout |
| `{{bench_config.foot_of_pleading_requirements}}` | e.g., Delhi 2018: advocate name + enrolment + phone + email mandatory at foot |
| `{{bench_config.paper_size}}` | `A4` (most) / `Legal` (some Original Side practices) |
| `{{bench_config.line_spacing}}` | `1.5` (most), `2.0` (Delhi 2018, Punjab & Haryana, double-spacing benches) |
| `{{bench_config.font_size_body}}` | `14` (most), `12` (some State Manuals) |
| `{{bench_config.margins}}` | bench-specific margin block |

For every case type, the final output is a SINGLE `.docx` file containing all sections in this order:

This list is auto-generated by Drafter from the inline markers in FACTS, observing the bench's annexure-letter-omission rule (e.g., Karnataka HC omits letter I). Verifier cross-checks.

## ⑤ ACCOMPANYING APPLICATIONS

Case-type-specific. Examples (each with own cause title + own facts + own prayer + own counsel block, all rendered in the bench's idiom):

- **Criminal Appeal:**
  - APPLICATION UNDER SECTION 389(1) Cr.P.C. AND 430(1) BNSS FOR SUSPENSION OF SENTENCE AND FOR BAIL
  - APPLICATION UNDER SECTION 5 OF LIMITATION ACT FOR CONDONATION OF DELAY (where filed late)
- **Civil/Criminal WP, First Appeal:** Stay Application (where interim relief needed)
- **Bail/ABA/482/Contempt/PIL:** typically standalone, no accompanying

The extending case-type skill specifies which applications attach.

## CASE-TYPE SKILL CONTRACT

Every case-type skill that extends this base must provide:

```yaml
# In the case-type skill's SKILL.md:
extends: _hc_pleading_base

statutory_opening: |
  <case-type-specific opening clause, e.g.,
   "CRIMINAL APPEAL UNDER SECTION 374(2) OF Cr.P.C. READ WITH
    SECTION 415(2) OF BNSS, 2023.">

case_type_line: "CRIMINAL APPEAL"   # used in cause title
case_short_code: "APEAL"            # the HC taxonomy code (varies by HC)

grounds_structure: |
  <case-type-specific opening grounds + style notes>

prayer_template: |
  <case-type-specific primary prayer language>

accompanying_applications:
  - suspension_of_sentence
  - condonation_of_delay
```

## THE USER PROVIDES BENCH-CONFIG AND CASE-TYPE FORMAT

The skeleton above is **structure only**. Two layers are user-supplied:

1. **bench-config.md** in the case folder — provides every `{{bench_config.X}}` value for the user's specific HC bench. Exemplars for the major HCs are in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bench-config/exemplars/`. The user copies the exemplar for their bench, then files the case-folder copy.

2. **format-from-user.md** in each case-type skill folder — provides the user's preferred drafting style for connective phrases within their bench's framework. Drafter uses this for style alignment.

The plugin does NOT assume any HC bench's specific values from training data. Every bench-specific value comes from the user's bench-config.

- **Stub · community contribution welcomed:** Bench is named but bench-config exemplar is a minimal placeholder; advocates practising at this bench are invited to submit a filled exemplar via PR.
