# Shared Drafting Common — Rules & Constraints (Indian High Courts)

This file is referenced from every drafting skill in the `indian-hc-drafting` plugin. It is NOT invoked on its own.

The plugin's core design principle: a uniform structural skeleton across Indian HCs, with bench-specific Registry-facing values supplied by the user via `<case-folder>/bench-config.md` at run-time.

## THE ENFORCEMENT RULES (non-negotiable)

1. **No external-memory MCP tools in drafting skills.** Drafting skill `allowed-tools:` lists MUST exclude any external-memory, vault, or cloud-sync MCP tool. A drafting skill operates strictly on the case folder. Hard wall.

2. **Case-folder scoping.** Every drafting skill auto-fires only when the user is working inside a case folder. The plugin ships with NO hardcoded case path — the path is user-controlled.

3. **Per-case CLAUDE.md is OPT-IN, self-contained.** No external imports. Case context only — parties, court, judge, key dates, counsel's role.

4. **Bench-config is mandatory.** Every case folder must contain a `bench-config.md` identifying the user's HC bench and specifying the bench-specific values. The Reader agent halts the pipeline if `bench-config.md` is absent or has unfilled placeholders. **The plugin does NOT default to any specific HC's conventions.** Bombay HC Nagpur values are the author's most-validated exemplar but they are NOT the universal default.

5. **🔴 LAYER 2 IS APPEND-ONLY FROM SKILL/AGENT SIDE.**
   - Skills/agents may: READ existing files in case folder, WRITE new draft files (case-facts.md, format-shell.md, draft-v*.docx, etc.), EDIT files they themselves created in this session
   - Skills/agents may NOT: rm, mv, rmdir, trash, rename, delete, overwrite-without-versioning

5.1. **🔴 WORKING-COPY RULE — never operate on originals.**
   When an agent needs to convert / extract / transform any existing case file, it MUST create a working copy under `~/.claude/working-copies/<case-name>/` and operate on the copy only. The original file is NEVER opened-for-write.

## LOCKED CONSTRAINTS (Indian High Court AI-use risk — all HCs, not Bombay only)

> Multiple Indian High Courts (Bombay, Delhi, Madras, Kerala) and the Supreme Court of India have publicly cautioned advocates against AI-use that produced hallucinated citations. **One hallucinated authority before any Indian HC = career-threatening.** This rule applies regardless of which HC bench the case is filed at.

These rules apply to every drafting agent:

- **NO internet for facts.** No WebSearch, no WebFetch for case content. Hardcoded sources only (the case folder + law PDFs supplied by the user).
- **Statutes from training data ONLY for:** Constitution of India, CPC 1908, CrPC 1973, IPC 1860, IEA 1872, BNS 2023, BNSS 2023, BSA 2023. All other statutes (POCSO, NDPS, MV Act, IT Act, Arbitration Act, etc.) must be supplied by the user as PDF before they can be cited. Reader flags missing law PDFs and STOPS.
- **Case citations — STRICT.** Every case citation in the output MUST trace to the user-supplied `citations.md`. Drafter NEVER generates a case name + citation pair from training memory. Where a ground requires support and no user-supplied citation matches, the Drafter writes `[CITATION NEEDED: <legal proposition>]` and the Verifier flags it.
- **File-based pipeline.** Each agent writes its output to a file → next agent reads. Auditable chain of custody.
- **Triple-verify.** Verifier + Refiner + Overseer = 3 independent passes before the draft is shown to the user.
- **Final draft must be indistinguishable from a manually-drafted pleading.** No "AI-style" markers.
- **The user remains the responsible advocate.** The plugin is a drafting aid; every draft must be reviewed before filing.

## BENCH-CONFIG-DRIVEN FORMATTING CONVENTIONS

The plugin operates on a uniform structural skeleton; **bench-specific Registry-facing values are sourced from `<case-folder>/bench-config.md` at run-time.** No bench's conventions are hardcoded in this plugin's skills or agents. Every `{{bench_config.X}}` placeholder in the case-type skills resolves to a value the user supplies in their bench-config.

Per-HC bench-config exemplars in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bench-config/exemplars/` cover the major Indian HCs:

## ANNEXURE MECHANISM (bench-config-driven)

Inline marker in Facts → consolidated table at end of pleading. The marker style is **bench-config-driven**:

```
{{bench_config.section_header.facts}}

  - "...the Judgment dated <DD.MM.YYYY> ... is annexed herewith and marked as {{bench_config.annexure_prefix}}A."
  - "...the FIR dated <DD.MM.YYYY> is annexed herewith and marked as {{bench_config.annexure_prefix}}B."
  - "...depositions of <N> witnesses are annexed collectively as {{bench_config.annexure_prefix}}C (Colly)."
  - (For Karnataka HC: skip letter I per Writ Proceedings Rules 1977. Use the next letter J directly.)

LIST OF ANNEXURES
| Sr.No | {{bench_config.annexure_column_label}} | Particulars                                | Date          | Pgs |
| 1.    | A                                          | Copy of Judgment ... <Case No./Year>       | <DD.MM.YYYY>  | <N> |
| 2.    | B                                          | Copy of FIR                                 | <DD.MM.YYYY>  | <N> |
| 3.    | C (Colly)                                  | Depositions of <N> witnesses                | various       | <N> |
```

Drafter MUST keep inline markers and List of Annexures in sync. Verifier checks for orphan markers AND checks the bench-specific letter-omission rule (Karnataka HC: letter I).

## STANDARD PLEADING SECTIONS (in order, all in one .docx)

For every Indian HC pleading, the `.docx` contains:

1. **Main pleading** (Cause title → Parties → Statutory opening → Prelude → FACTS → GROUNDS → PRAYER → Counsel block → Notes/Limitation if applicable)
2. **Index** (table form)
3. **Synopsis** (Dates–Events + Points to be Considered + Acts & Rules + Citations)
4. **List of Annexures** (consolidated)
5. **Accompanying applications** (case-type-specific):
   - Criminal Appeal → +Suspension of Sentence (S.389/430 BNSS) +Condonation of Delay (S.5 Lim Act, where late)
   - Civil/Criminal WP → +Stay App (sometimes)
   - First Appeal → +Stay App (sometimes)
   - Bail/ABA/482/Contempt/PIL → typically standalone

Each accompanying application repeats its own cause title (in the bench's idiom), has its own facts, its own prayer, its own counsel block.

## OUTPUT FORMAT

- **File type:** `.docx`
- **Conversion tool:** pandoc (if installed) with a `reference.docx` template for the user's bench (paper size + font + spacing + margins per `bench-config.md`). Fallback: python-docx.
- **Output filename convention:** `<case-type>_<draft-version>_<YYYY-MM-DD>.docx`
- **NEVER overwrite an existing draft.** Each run produces a new versioned file.

## RECOVERY / AUDIT

If anyone asks "how was this drafted":
1. Show the file chain: `case-facts.md` → `bench-config.md` → `format-shell.md` → `draft-v1.docx` → `verification-report.md` → `draft-v2.docx` → `opposing-notes.md` → `final-draft.docx`
2. Each file has timestamp + agent that produced it
3. Inputs (source PDFs, law PDFs, bench-config) all listed in `case-facts.md` Section 1
4. Bench-config explicitly cites the HC bench's Rules + Practice Notes that anchor the formatting choices

This is the audit-defense kit for any AI-use challenge before any Indian HC.
